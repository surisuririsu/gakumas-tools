/**
 * Validator schema.
 *
 * Whitelists of every identifier/function/phase/field the structured
 * engine understands. The validator walks parsed ASTs and flags any name
 * not in these sets — catches migration typos and DSL drift at data-build
 * time instead of during silent test divergence.
 *
 * Every set here derives from the engine itself:
 *   - PHASES, STATE_FIELDS: imported directly from engine/constants.js
 *   - SPECIAL_ACTIONS, VARIABLE_RESOLVERS: instantiate the real engine
 *     components against a stub engine and read back the keys of their
 *     `specialActions` / `variableResolvers` maps.
 * Adding or renaming a field/phase/action/resolver in the engine updates
 * the schema automatically on the next validator run — no manual edits.
